## Project Summary

Our proposed final project is to implement the 'Boyer Moore Algorithm' to find the first occurrence of the specific string from a large text consisting of strings.

## Code

This `code/` directory contains test cases and all code needed to run the project.
1. Create a `build` directory inside `code/`

2. CD into `build` and run `cmake ..` and `make`.

3. Modify the `main.cpp` file to run whichever `.txt` file you want to test.


## Data

In `data/` directory, the test data contains multiples text files that can be used to test the algorith. One file will be empty, and the rest will contain "passages" of increasing length.  For each file of a certain size, a separate file will be created that will also fall in the same size group but contain duplicates.

## Documents

The proposal and **Average running time of the Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm.pdf** can be found in the `documents/` directory.

## Results

The `results/` directory contains the output of our project.
