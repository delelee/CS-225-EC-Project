# CS-225-EC-Project
Extra Credit Project by [Sunwoo Baek](https://github.com/sbaek21) and [Shrivatsa Patil](https://github.com/fafu-10).

## Project Summary

Our proposed final project is to implement the 'Boyer Moore Algorithm' to find the first occurrence of the specific string and a large text.

## Code

This `code/` directory contains test cases and all the codes we need to run the project.


## Data

The test data contains one file that is empty, and the rest will be of increasing sizes. For each file of a certain size, a separate file will be created that will also fall in the same size group but contain duplicates.

## Documents

The proposal and **Average running time of the Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm.pdf** can be found in the `documents/` directory.
